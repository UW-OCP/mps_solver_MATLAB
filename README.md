# mps_solver_MATLAB
Multiple shooting method for solving optimal control problems

The repo contains two directories: 1)mps_OCP; 2) mps_BVP.

The directory mps_OCP contains the solver that can directly solves the optimal control problem (OCP) defined in the specific format and gives the optimal solution.

The input is just the plain text file with the specific defined name fileds and the ouputs are the optimal solutions of various variables of the OCP.
